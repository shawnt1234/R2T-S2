# R2T-S2
A modified version of the [reads2trees](https://github.com/kheyduk/reads2trees) pipeline (Created by Dr. Karolina Heyduk) for batch job submission on UGA's Sapelo2 Cluster.

Required Programs: Perl, BioPerl, Python, Trimmomatic, SPAdes, CAP3, BLAST, PRANK, RAxML, ASTRAL

These scripts were written and designed for use on a linux cluster. The scripts are hard coded for batch job submission on UGA's sapelo2 cluster and need to be modified if used with other queuing systems.
